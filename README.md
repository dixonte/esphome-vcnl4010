# ![ESPHome logo](esphome-logo.png) VCNL4010 custom component

A good-enough-for-me custom component to read the VCNL4010 proximity sensor and present its values to ESPHome.

# Special thanks

Thanks to [this project](https://github.com/jesserockz/esphome-external-component-examples/) without which I would have had a much harder time getting started.
